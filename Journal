The Journal is a component of systemd that is responsible for viewing and management of log files. It can be used in parallel, or in place of a traditional syslog daemon, such as rsyslogd. The Journal was developed to address problems connected with traditional logging. It is closely integrated with the rest of the system, supports various logging technologies and access management for the log files.

Viewing Log Files

To access the journal logs, use the journalctl tool

# journalctl

An output of this command is a list of all log files generated on the system including messages generated by system components and by users. The structure of this output is similar to one used in /var/log/messages/ but with certain improvements:

the priority of entries is marked visually. Lines of error priority and higher are highlighted with red color and a bold font is used for lines with notice and warning priority
the time stamps are converted for the local time zone of your system
all logged data is shown, including rotated logs
the beginning of a boot is tagged with a special line

Display newest log entries first

# journalctl -r

Display specific number of recent log entries

# journalctl -n 3

Display log entries of specific priority

# journalctl -p crit

Valid priorities are debug, info, notice, warning, err, crit, alert, and emerg. 

Display log entries only for specific systemd unit

# journalctl -u ntpd

Formatting the output

Use the â€“o [output_form] option to format the output. Valid output formats are short, short-iso, short-precise, short-monotonic, verbose, export, json, jsonpretty, json-see, and cat.

# journalctl -o verbose

Combining options

You can also combine various options used in the examples above as per your requirement. For example, to show the latest 3 log entries of priority critical, use the below command.

# journalctl -n 3 -p crit
